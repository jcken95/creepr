# The {creepr} R package: it's just {beepr} but scary

## Installation instructions

You can install {creepr} in the following way

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jcken95/creepr")
```

{creepr} is not yet on CRAN, and I have no plans to put it on CRAN anytime soon. 

## About

For those unfamiliar with {beepr} the `beepr::beepr()` command tells the machine to make a noise. This package is very similar but the `creepr::creepr()` command will make you really scared.
