# The {creepr} R package: it's just {beepr} but scary <img src="inst/hexsticker/hexsticker.png" align="right" height="138"/>

For those unfamiliar with {beepr} the `beepr::beepr()` command tells the machine to make a noise. This package is very similar but the `creepr::creepr()` command will make you really scared.

## Installation instructions

You can install {creepr} in the following way

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jcken95/creepr")
```

{creepr} is not yet on CRAN, and I have no plans to put it on CRAN anytime soon.
